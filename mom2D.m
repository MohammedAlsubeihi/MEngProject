%% Store variables to solve

m00 = y(1);
m10 = y(2);
m01 = y(3);
m20 = y(4);
m11 = y(5);
m21 = y(6);
c = y(7);

%% Necessary parameters

S = c/solubility;
G1 = k11*(S-1)^k12;
G2 = k21*(S-1)^k22;

%% ODE system

dm00dt = 0; %for the case of no nucleation, this shouldn't change - used to verify simulation
dm10dt = G1*m00;
dm01dt = G2*m11;
dm20dt = 2*G1*m11;
dm11dt = G1*m01 + G2*m10;
dm21dt = 2*G1*m11 + G2*m20;
dcdt = -particleDensity*shapeFactor*dm21dt;

ddt = [dm00dt; dm10dt; dm01dt; dm20dt; dm11dt; dm21dt; dcdt];
